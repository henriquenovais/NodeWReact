# NodeWReact
***IMPORTANT ALERT: I tried creating this repository for learning both React and Node but it ended up being too much material for just one repository. If you intend to learn React please look for my ReactFromScratch repository and my React101 repository. This repository is used by me as an archive of my past practices.*** 


This is a repository dedicated to the study and the production of didatic material related to NodeJS and React.

<h1>NodeJS Basics</h1>

<b>NodeJsBasics</b> has a files based on the Udemy course given by professor Jorge Sant Ana at <a href="https://www.udemy.com/curso-completo-do-desenvolvedor-nodejs/l">https://www.udemy.com/curso-completo-do-desenvolvedor-nodejs/</a>.

Important concepts used in this part of the project are: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-view-controller</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_access_object"> DAO</a>.


Hope this helps on your journey through web development.
